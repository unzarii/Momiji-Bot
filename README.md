# Momiji-Bot
Yet another bot, this time in the theme of a popular Touhou character

# Required Stuff
- Node 18.16.1
- discord.js 14.11.0
- moment 2.29.4
- seedrandom 3.0.5
- sequelize 6.32.1
- sqlite3 5.1.6

# Before You Run
- You will need to configure the bot via "config - base.json". Rename the file to "config.json" when you are finished.

# How to host
- run "npm run deploy" to deploy slash commands (once)
- run "npm run dbInit" to create database (once)
- run "npm run start" to run Momiji (or use "Run Momiji Bot.bat"). On Windows, if you have Nodemon, you can use "Run Momiji Bot Nodemon.bat".
- Highly suggest pm2 for Linux.
